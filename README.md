# Awesome Tab
#### By: [Zachary](https://twitter.com/zacimac) and [Darth Torus](https://twitter.com/Darth_Torus)
A website that users can set to replace the browsers new tab page to instead have a beautiful and advanced yet easy to use user interface.

Planed to become a chrome extension and possibly a Firefox extension. Although user's are able to just set it as a deafault new tab page.

# Some layout ideas
## IN PROGRESS!
